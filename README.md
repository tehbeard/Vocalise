#Vocalise

##About Vocalise

Vocalise is a project to provide a set of tools for people using the Conversation API in bukkit.  

##Project Goals

* Provide a series of high level prompts that can be utilised by other developers to create rich interfaces  
with users.

* A mechanism to allow complex prompt graphs to be constructed from a file, rather then by large amounts of  
boilerplate code
