{"name":"Vocalise","body":"#Vocalise\r\n\r\n##About Vocalise\r\n\r\nVocalise is a project to provide a set of tools for people using the Conversation API in bukkit.  \r\n\r\n## Why this project came about\r\n\r\nWhile the conversation API has provided a very powerful mechanism for developers, both for allowing \"conversation\"\r\nwith entities as well as guided configuration for plugins, the lack of concrete implmentations for standard prompts\r\nsuch as messages offers great flexibility and complexity.\r\n\r\nThis is where Vocalise comes in. Vocalise is a set of classes that provide Concrete versions of the various prompts\r\nin order to speed up coding of the static parts of a conversation graph.\r\n\r\nVocalise also provides `PromptBuilder()`. PromptBuilder parses Yaml files (either in the file system or inside the jar\r\nusing the `getResource(String)` function, creating a prompt graph.\r\nCurrently PromptBuilder supports a number of internal Prompt types (see config.md). You are also able to inject Custom Prompt classes into PromptBuilder, exposing them for scripting.\r\n\r\n##Project Goals\r\n\r\n* Provide a series of high level prompts that can be utilised by other developers to create rich interfaces  \r\nwith users.\r\n\r\n* A mechanism to allow complex prompt graphs to be constructed from a file, rather then by large amounts of  \r\nboilerplate code.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Adds a layer of sweetness to the Bukkit Conversation API","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
